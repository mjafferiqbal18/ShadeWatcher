Load ground truth.

After split in 80, 20
    Check if 80 contains any malicious interactions
    if yes, swap with interaction from val_test data

After, everything runs normally for training. 

At validation and testing,
    if above threshold, if interaction is labelled malicious == tp
                            else == fp
    else if below threshold, if interaction is labelled malicious == fn
                                else == tn
